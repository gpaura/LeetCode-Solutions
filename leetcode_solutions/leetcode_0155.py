# Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MinStack()
# obj.push(val)
# obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.getMin()

# Time complexity: Overall, all of the operations of the MinStack class run in constant time, so we have O(1) time complexity for push, pop, top, and getMin methods.
# Space complexity: the overall space complexity of the MinStack class is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the stack.
